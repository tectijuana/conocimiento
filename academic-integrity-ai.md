## Definition of Academic Integrity Violations

### Plagiarism

Plagiarism is the unauthorized use or close imitation of the language, ideas, or thoughts of another person and representing them as one's own original work.

**Forms of Plagiarism**:

1. **Direct Plagiarism**: Copying text word-for-word without quotation marks and citation
2. **Self-Plagiarism**: Reusing one's own previous work without disclosure or permission
3. **Mosaic Plagiarism**: Piecing together phrases, sentences, or ideas from sources without proper attribution
4. **Accidental Plagiarism**: Failing to cite sources due to negligence or misunderstanding (still a violation)
5. **Paraphrasing without Citation**: Rewording someone else's ideas without giving credit

**Examples in Context**:
- Copying paragraphs from academic papers or technical documentation
- Using another student's research paper structure or content
- Incorporating AI-generated text without disclosure
- Reusing portions of previous coursework without explicit permission

### Fabrication and Falsification

- **Fabrication**: Creating or inventing data, sources, or citations
- **Falsification**: Manipulating or altering research data, sources, or documentation

**Examples**:
- Inventing sources or citations that do not exist
- Misrepresenting the content or conclusions of cited sources
- Altering quotations or data to support your argument
- Creating fake research results or case studies

### Unauthorized Collaboration

While collaboration during research is encouraged, the final submission must be individual work.

**Prohibited**:
- Sharing written content or code between students
- Submitting jointly written papers without explicit permission
- Having another person write substantial portions of your paper
- Copying structural elements or arguments from peers

**Permitted**:
- Discussing research topics and ideas
- Sharing references and sources
- Peer reviewing drafts and providing feedback
- Collaborative study and discussion of course material

### Multiple Submission

- Submitting the same or substantially similar work for multiple courses without disclosure and permission
- Reusing previous work from other institutions or contexts without authorization
