# Knowledge Management in ITICS Engineering

## Course Context

This repository serves as the centralized knowledge management system for the ITICS  Engineering program at Instituto Tecnológico de Tijuana. The primary objective is to foster a collaborative learning environment where students contribute to a comprehensive knowledge base through rigorous research, analysis, and documentation of advanced topics in computer engineering.

## Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Conduct Academic Research**: Demonstrate proficiency in identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing relevant academic and technical literature in computer engineering domains.

2. **Technical Writing Competency**: Produce high-quality technical documentation adhering to academic standards, including proper citation, formal language, and logical argumentation.

3. **Collaborative Knowledge Construction**: Contribute to a shared knowledge repository through peer review and iterative refinement of research contributions.

4. **Critical Analysis**: Evaluate emerging technologies, methodologies, and theoretical frameworks with appropriate academic rigor and critical thinking.

5. **Version Control Proficiency**: Demonstrate competence in using Git and GitHub workflows for collaborative academic work, including branching, pull requests, and code review processes.

## Submission Process

All student contributions to this repository must follow the Pull Request (PR) workflow outlined below:

### Workflow Overview

1. **Fork and Clone**: Students must fork this repository to their personal GitHub account and clone it to their local development environment.

2. **Create Feature Branch**: Before making any changes, create a descriptive feature branch following the naming convention: `student-name/topic-name`.

3. **Develop Contribution**: Complete your research paper and associated documentation within your designated student folder in the `/submissions` directory.

4. **Commit and Push**: Make logical, incremental commits with descriptive commit messages. Push your feature branch to your forked repository.

5. **Submit Pull Request**: Open a pull request from your feature branch to the main repository's default branch. The PR description must include:
   - A concise summary of your research topic
   - Reference to the relevant syllabus alignment
   - Confirmation of adherence to submission guidelines
   - Academic integrity declaration

6. **Peer Review**: Engage constructively with feedback from instructors and peers. Address all requested changes and comments.

7. **Approval and Merge**: Once your submission meets all quality standards and assessment criteria, it will be approved and merged into the main repository.

### Important Guidelines

- **Individual Contributions**: Each student is responsible for their own work. Collaboration is encouraged during the research phase, but submissions must represent individual effort.

- **Deadline Adherence**: Pull requests must be submitted by the specified deadline. Late submissions may be subject to grade penalties as outlined in the assessment rubric.

- **Continuous Improvement**: Students are encouraged to update and refine their contributions based on feedback even after initial acceptance.
